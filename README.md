# FIFA World Cup Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project is focused on performing an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on FIFA World Cup data. The goal is to uncover patterns, trends, and insights related to world rankings, match statistics, and World Cup performances over the years.

## Project Overview

The analysis consists of several steps aimed at understanding the structure, distribution, and relationships within the data. It includes data loading, preprocessing, visualization, and statistical insights to explore the dataset effectively.

### Steps Performed in the Project

1. **Data Loading**
   - The datasets used in this project include:
     - `fifa_ranking_2022-10-06.csv`: Contains the FIFA world rankings as of October 6, 2022.
     - `world_cup.csv`: Records of World Cup tournaments, teams, and their performance.
     - `matches_1930_2022.csv`: Match details from 1930 to 2022.
   - The data is loaded using `pandas` and basic inspection is performed.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Basic operations such as checking for null values and understanding the structure of the data are conducted.
   - Dataframes are filtered and merged where necessary to prepare for analysis.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - **Data Inspection**:
     - Shapes of the datasets are printed.
     - Summaries and basic statistics are computed.
   - **Handling Missing Data**:
     - Percentage of missing values in each column is calculated to decide on data cleaning strategies.
   - **Visual Analysis**:
     - Bar plots, histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps are created using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
     - Interactive plots with `plotly` and `plotly.express` are used for better exploration and visual storytelling.

4. **Key Visualizations and Insights**
   - Ranking trends over time.
   - Performance analysis of top teams.
   - Goals scored and conceded in different World Cup tournaments.
   - Head-to-head comparisons of teams using interactive charts.

## Prerequisites

The project requires the following Python libraries:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `plotly`


## Dataset

The datasets used in this project include:

- **`fifa_ranking_2022-10-06.csv`**: FIFA world rankings data.
- **`world_cup.csv`**: Information on various World Cup tournaments.
- **`matches_1930_2022.csv`**: Historical match data from 1930 to 2022.

### Data Structure

- The `world_ranking` dataset contains columns like `rank`, `country`, and `total_points`.
- The `world_cup` dataset provides details such as `year`, `winner`, `runners-up`, `goals_scored`, and more.
- The `matches` dataset includes comprehensive match information like `date`, `home_team`, `away_team`, `home_score`, `away_score`, and various statistics related to the games.

## Insights and Conclusion

This EDA reveals various trends and insights into the FIFA World Cup tournaments and team rankings over the years. Notable trends in match outcomes, team performances, and ranking fluctuations are identified, providing a foundation for deeper analysis or predictive modeling.

## Future Scope

- Extending the analysis to include player-level data.
- Building predictive models to forecast match outcomes or ranking changes.
- Visualizing the impact of key events (e.g., penalties, red cards) on match results.
